# ADAS – Deep Learning Models 🚗

An Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) project for real-time road perception using deep learning. Implements lane segmentation, object detection, and time-to-collision (TTC) estimation on video streams.

## Highlights
- Lane detection & geometry estimation  
- Vehicle and obstacle detection (YOLO-based)  
- TTC-based collision awareness  
- Modular, production-oriented pipeline  

## Tech Stack
Python • PyTorch / TensorFlow • OpenCV • YOLOv5

## Usage
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app/main.py
